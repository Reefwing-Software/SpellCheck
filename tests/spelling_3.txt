I always enjoyd gardening, it's such a relaxing activty. This morning, 
I got up erly to plant some new flowers. I chosed vibrant roses and 
sunflowers, cause they're my favorit. While diging the soil, I found 
a little worm. I carefuly placed it aside, not wanting to hurt it. 
My neighbour, who often gives me advices on plants, came over. He 
notised that I was planting the flowers to close together. He suggest 
to give them more space to grow. After he left, I rearranged the plants. 
By the end of the day, my garden looked absolutly beautiful.
