Wun sunny day, I desided to vist my frend. I packed my things, and set of on a journey. 
The weathar was extremly plesant with sun shining brite. My frend's house wasnt far away, 
so I decided to walk. While walking, I seen many intresting things. Ther were childrens 
playing in the park, and a dog chasing its tail. I stopped to by some snacks from a local 
store. The store keeper was a vary kind man. He asked me where I was going and wished me 
a gud day. Finaly, I arived at my frendâ€™s house, and we spent a wonderful afternoon togther.
