Last week, I took my dog, Rocky, for a walk in the nearby forrest. 
It was a beutiful day, the sun was shining and the birds was singing. 
Rocky loves to run and chase squirls, he's very energetic. I brought 
a frisbe with me and we played catch for a while. Then, I noticed 
Rocky was sniffing something near a bush. He found a strange looking 
stick, but I was worried it might be a snake. Luckily, it was just a 
stick. We enjoyed our walk, but on the way back, Rocky jumped in a 
muddy puddle and got us both dirty!
