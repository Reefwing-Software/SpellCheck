Yesturday, I decided to bake a cake for my family. Baking isn't 
my strong suite, but I wanted to try anyway. I started by mixing 
the ingrediants. Flour, sugar, and eggs went into the bowl. However, 
I accidently dropped an entire bottle of vanila extract in it! I 
didn't know if it would ruin the cake, but continued anyway. After 
pouring the mix into the baking pan, I realized I forgot to preheat 
the oven. Once the oven was hot enough, I put the cake inside. 
Surprisingly, it came out tasting pretty good, despite the extra 
vanila and the delay!
